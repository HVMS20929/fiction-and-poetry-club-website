## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **"Authentication failed" error**:
   - Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular Gmail password
   - Ensure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
   - Double-check the 16-character app password

2. **"Connection refused" error**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify MAIL_SERVER and MAIL_PORT settings
   - Ensure MAIL_USE_TLS is set to true

3. **Emails not being sent**:
   - Check the console for error messages
   - Verify all email configuration in .env file
   - Test with a simple email first

4. **"SMTPAuthenticationError"**:
   - Regenerate the App Password
   - Make sure the email address is correct
   - Check if 2FA is properly enabled

### **Testing Steps**

1. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Look for any error messages when submitting forms
   - Email errors will be printed to the console

2. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Print email settings (temporarily) to verify they're loaded correctly
   - Test with a simple email first

3. **Gmail Security**:
   - Check Gmail's "Less secure app access" (if using older method)
   - Ensure App Passwords are enabled

## üöÄ Production Considerations

### **For Production Deployment**

1. **Use Environment Variables**:
   - Never hardcode passwords in your code
   - Use your hosting platform's environment variable system

2. **Email Service Providers**:
   - Consider using SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES for production
   - These services are more reliable than SMTP for high volume

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent spam
   - Add CAPTCHA for contact forms

4. **Email Templates**:
   - Use HTML email templates for better formatting
   - Add unsubscribe links for newsletters

## üì± Mobile Considerations

- Email forms work on all devices
- Flash messages are responsive
- Contact form is mobile-friendly

## üîí Security Notes

- App passwords are more secure than regular passwords
- Never commit .env files to version control
- Use HTTPS in production for secure email transmission
- Consider implementing email validation and sanitization
